'<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>This page provides a short tutorial for the online analysis interface for INTEGRAL/ISGRI data.<br/>\nMore details can be found on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12895" target="_blank">AstrODA paper</a>. This is a web interface runs the OSA INTEGRAL analysis on servers of the University of Geneva.<br/>\nDetails on INTEGRAL analysis can be found at the <a href="https://www.isdc.unige.ch/integral/analysis" target="_blank">ISDC pages</a>.<br/><strong>In each session, the analysis is limited to 50 science windows.<br/>\nIf a request takes too long for you to wait, just send it again after some hours: the results will appear in a few seconds, if the request is the same.</strong></p>\n<div class="toc-item-anchor"><a name="toc-1"></a></div><h2 class="toc-headings">Source query panel</h2><div class="toc-top-links"></div>\n<p>Top panel of the interface defines parameters of analysis not specific to ISGRI. You can select a source and a time interval. The tool will select for you<br/>\nat most 50 science windows within your time interval.</p>\n<p><img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/Top_oda_1.png" style="height:263px; width:600px"/></p>\n<p>\nThis panel could be used for multi-instrument analysis.</p>\n<div class="toc-item-anchor"><a name="toc-2"></a></div><h2 class="toc-headings">Instrument query panel</h2><div class="toc-top-links"></div>\n<p>ISGRI specific parameters appear when  "INTEGRAL ISGRI" button is selected in the virtual desktop field. Here you can select the search radius and if you want a list <br/>\nof science windows, you can just copy it here with the format of the figure below.</p>\n<p><img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/isgri_panel.png" style="height:880px; width:450px"/></p>\n<p>A box with parameters for imaging, spectral and timing analysis appears in this case.</p>\n<h1>Analysis thread</h1>\n<p>Generic analysis flow typically starts from Imaging analysis and proceeds through Imaging -&gt; Speactral and/or timing analysis chains. Spectral and timing analysis steps rely on results of the imaging analysis (on catalog of sources found in imaging analysis) and it is recommended to always start from the imaging analysis step. The analysis steps are described below:  </p>\n<div class="toc-item-anchor"><a name="toc-3"></a></div><h2 class="toc-headings">QUERY DATA</h2><div class="toc-top-links"></div>\n<ol><li>Start analysis from choosing the source name of interest. Coordinates are resolved with the "Resolve" button, but you can in alternative give coordinates.<br/><img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/Top_oda_1.png" style="height:263px; width:600px"/></li>\n<li>Define time interval for the data. This could be done either in the "Start time" / "End time" fields in the multi-instrument top panel. It is also possible to provide the list of telescope pointings (Science Windows, SCW) in the dedicated parameter box in parameter box in INTEGRAL ISGRI panel. Note that SCW list input overrides the generic time interval input. Maximum number of SCWs is currently limited to 50. Format is "219900320010.001,219900330010.001".<br/><img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/Top_oda_2.png" style="height:263px; width:600px"/></li>\n</ol><div class="toc-item-anchor"><a name="toc-4"></a></div><h2 class="toc-headings">IMAGING ANALYSIS</h2><div class="toc-top-links"></div>\n<ol><li>Select "Image" checkbox and enter the energy interval for image extraction. Note that the analysis results are cached and entering "standard" energy bounds (e.g. 20-40 keV for OSA10.2 or 28-40 for OSA 11.0) might speed up the analysis because exsiting results would be evoked from cache memory rather than produced from scratch).</li>\n<li>Optionally enter parameters for image and imaging results display: limits for the minimum and maximum significance which define the image color scale and minimal significance of detected source to be displayed in the imaging results catalog.</li>\n<li>Launch imaging analysis by pressing "Submit" button at the bottom of the INTEGRAL ISGRI parameter panel.</li>\n<li>After a while, mosaic image is displayed in the centre of workspace. Inspect the image to check if your source of interest is detected.</li>\n<li>Click on "Catalog" button. If your source of interest is detected in mosaic with significance higher than previously defined significance threshold, the source should appear in the catalog. You also have an option to download the spectrum in FITS format for further analysis. "Share" will provide a link to the product. "API code" the code for the python ODA API. "API token" a token that will be used for the python API in future developments.\n<p> <img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/Ima_oda.png" style="height:741px; width:892px"/></p></li>\n</ol><div class="toc-item-anchor"><a name="toc-5"></a></div><h2 class="toc-headings">SPECTRAL ANALYSIS</h2><div class="toc-top-links"></div>\n<ol><li>Prepare catalog for the spectral analysis from an image result. When you check a source, you can make an operation on it, like deleting or saving. The catalog which appears will be used for the analysis when you click on "use catalog". Note that you can load also a previously extracted catalog from the box of the specialized analysis.\n<p> <img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/Oda_catalog.png" style="height:324px; width:700px"/>                             <img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/catalog_box.png" style="height:461px; width:300px"/></p></li>\n<li>If no source is checked or you forget to click on "use catalog", the full imaging catalog will be given as input for the spectral analysis. Spectra of all sources found in imaging will be generated (processing might take more time in this case). If there sources brighter than your source of interest in the mosaic image it is advised to include at least all the brighter sources in the spectral analysis. Otherwise the spectrum of the source of interest could not be reliable.</li>\n<li>Check the "Spectum" box in INTEGRAL ISGRI parameter field. Optionally choose the default spectral model for spectral analysis by entering the name of one of the valid XSPEC models in the additional parameter field which displays when "Spectrum" box is checked.</li>\n<li>Launch spectral analysis by clicking "Submit" button. Once the analysis is done, a panel with the list of sources for which the spectra were produced displays in the centre of the INTEGRAL ISGRI workspace. You could click on "Fit" button next to your source of interest to see the results of the analysis. This includes a plot of the spectrum and the result of the spectral model fitting in XSPEC. You also have a possibility to download the spectrum in FITS format for further analysis.\n<p> <img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/Spectrum_ODA_0.png" style="height:495px; width:800px"/></p></li>\n</ol><div class="toc-item-anchor"><a name="toc-6"></a></div><h2 class="toc-headings">TIMING ANALYSIS</h2><div class="toc-top-links"></div>\n<ol><li>\n<p>Check the "Lightcurve" checkbox. An additional set of parameters for lightcurve production shows up at the bottom of INTEGRAL ISGRI parameter panel. Enter the width of the time bin for the lightcurve. The Start and end time of the lightcurve are determined by the time limits set in the top multi-instrument panel or by the list of SCWs in the INTEGRAL ISGRI parameter panel. Note that the maximum number of SCWs is 50. Maximal length of the time bin in the lightcurve is one SCW. If a time bin smaller but similar to the science duration is selected, the light curve will have also shorted bins, which will complete the science window duration (this is afeature of OSA for ISGRI).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The use of catalog is the same as in the spectral extraction. Launch the lightcurve extraction by pressing "Submit" button</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once the lightcurve is produced, you can click on the "View" button for your source of interest. "Copy" button is for further developments.</p>\n<p> <img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/LC_ODA.png" style="height:298px; width:300px"/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The light curve is displayed in the ISGRI workspace, together with the result of fitting on constant and linear function.  You have a possibility to download the lightcrve in FITS format for further analysis<br/>\n\t.<img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/lightcurve.png" style="height:552px; width:450px"/><br/>\n\t </p>\n</li>\n</ol><div class="toc-item-anchor"><a name="toc-7"></a></div><h2 class="toc-headings">CAVEATS / KNOWN ISSUES</h2><div class="toc-top-links"></div>\n<p>A) If the source is not detected on single SCW level no empty lightcurve file is produced.</p>\n<p>B) Maximal width of the lightcurve time bin is now one SCW. Enetring longer time bin width would result in generation of SCW-by-SCW lightcurve.</p>\n<p>C) Entering width of the time bin shorter than 10 seconds for the timing extraction would lead to exceedingly long processing time and finally to the timeout of the session because of the specific of currently used spectral extraction tool, <em>ii_lc_extract</em>. Possibility to choose between  <em>ii_lc_extract</em>  and an alternative tool, <em>ii_light</em> , is foreseen for further development.</p>\n'
