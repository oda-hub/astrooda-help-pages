Spectral and timing analysis steps rely on results of the imaging analysis (on catalog of sources found in imaging analysis) and it is recommended to always start from the imaging analysis step. The analysis steps are described below:  </p>\n<div class="toc-item-anchor"><a name="toc-3"></a></div><h2 class="toc-headings">QUERY DATA</h2><div class="toc-top-links"></div>\n<ol><li>Start analysis from choosing the source name of interest and specifying souce coordinates (automatic source name resolution will be added at later stage, now coordinates should be entered manually).<br/><img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/top_panel1.png" style="height:205px; width:700px"/></li>\n<li>Define time interval for the data. This could be done either in the "Start time" / "End time" fields in the multi-instrument top panel or by selecting the time interval in INTEGRAL-specific way, i.e. by providing the list of telescope pointings (Science Windows, SCW) in the dedicated parameter box in parameter box in INTEGRAL ISGRI panel. Note that SCW list input overrides the generic time interval input. Maximum number of SCWs is currently limited to 50 for the testing phase period.<br/><img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/top_panel2.png" style="height:205px; width:700px"/></li>\n</ol><div class="toc-item-anchor"><a name="toc-4"></a></div><h2 class="toc-headings">IMAGING ANALYSIS</h2><div class="toc-top-links"></div>\n<ol><li>Select "Image" checkbox and enter the energy interval for image extraction. Note that the analysis results are cached and entering "standard" energy bounds (e.g. 20-40 keV) might speed up the analysis because exsiting results would be evoked from cache memory rather than produced from scratch).</li>\n<li>Optionally enter parameters for image and imaging results display: limits for the minimum and maximum significance which define the image color scale and minimal significance of detected source to be displayed in the imaging results catalog.</li>\n<li>Launch imaging analysis by pressing "Submit" button at the bottom of the INTEGRAL ISGRI parameter panel.</li>\n<li>Mosaic image is displayed in the centre of workspace. Inspect the image to check if your source of interest is detected.</li>\n<li>Click on "Show catalog" button. If your source of interest is detected in mosaic with significance higher than previously defined significance threshold, the source should appear in the catalog. You also have an option to download the spectrum in FITS format for further analysis.<br/><img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/isgri_image.png" style="height:448px; width:450px"/></li>\n</ol><div class="toc-item-anchor"><a name="toc-5"></a></div><h2 class="toc-headings">SPECTRAL ANALYSIS</h2><div class="toc-top-links"></div>\n<ol><li>Prepare catalog for spectral analysis by checking the sources which should be included from the imaging analysis results catalog.<br/><img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/catalog.png" style="height:192px; width:300px"/></li>\n<li>If no source is checked, the full imaging catalog will be given as input for the spectral analysis. Spectra of all sources found in imaging will be generated (processing might take more time in this case). If there sources brighter than your source of interest in the mosaic image it is advised to include at least all the brighter sources in the spectral analysis. Otherwise the spectrum of the source of interest would be not reliable.</li>\n<li>Check the "Spectum" box in INTEGRAL ISGRI parameter field. Optionally choose the default spectral model for spectral analysis by entering the name of one of the valid XSPEC models in the additional parameter field which displays when "Spectrum" box is checked.</li>\n<li>Launch spectral analysis by clicking "Submit" button. Once the analysis is done, a panel with the list of sources for which the spectra were produced displays in the centre of the INTEGRAL ISGRI workspace. You could click on "Show" button next to your source of interest to see the results of the analysis. This includes a plot of the spectrum and the result of the spectral model fitting in XSPEC. You also have a possibility to download the spectrum in FITS format for further analysis.<br/><img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/spectrum.png" style="height:537px; width:600px"/></li>\n</ol><div class="toc-item-anchor"><a name="toc-6"></a></div><h2 class="toc-headings">TIMING ANALYSIS</h2><div class="toc-top-links"></div>\n<ol><li>\n<p>Check the "Lightcurve" checkbox. An additional set of parameters for lightcurve production shows up at the bottom of INTEGRAL ISGRI parameter panel. Enter the width of the time bin for the lightcurve. The Start and end time of the lightcurve are determined by the time limits set in the top multi-instrument panel or by the list of SCWs in the INTEGRAL ISGRI parameter panel. Note that the maximum number of SCWs is 50 in the current testing version. Maximal length of the time bin in the lightcurve is one SCW.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be sure to provide correct source name in the top multi-instrument panel. During the testing phase the source name should match that in the INTEGRAL catalog. Source name recognition will be implemented later.<br/><img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/top_panel1.png" style="height:205px; width:700px"/></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Launch the lightcurve extraction by pressing "Submit" button. Once the lightcurve is produced, it displays in the center of the INTEGRAL ISGRI workspace, together with the result of fitting on constant and linear function. You have a possibility to download the lightcrve in FITS format for further analysis.<br/><img alt="" src="/cdci/astrooda/sites/default/files/lightcurve.png" style="height:552px; width:450px"/></p>\n</li>\n</ol><div class="toc-item-anchor"><a name="toc-7"></a></div><h2 class="toc-headings">CAVEATS / KNOWN ISSUES</h2><div class="toc-top-links"></div>\n<p>A) If the source is not detected on single SCW level no empty lightcurve file is produced.</p>\n<p>B) Maximal width of the lightcurve time bin is now one SCW. Enetring longer time bin width would result in generation of SCW-by-SCW lightcurve.</p>\n<p>C) Entering width of the time bin shorter than 10 seconds for the spectral extraction would lead to exceedingly long processing time and finally to the timeout of the session because of the specific of currently used spectral extraction tool, <em>ii_lc_extract</em> (during the testing period). Possibility to choose between  <em>ii_lc_extract</em>  and an alternative tool, <em>ii_light</em> , is foreseen for the production phase. </p>\n'
